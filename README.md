# Introduction

### Rereading notes is inefficient

Rereading your notes over and over again is not efficient, and really not fun. To remember your notes, you have to **retrieve** knowledge from your brain by writing things down, or playing some quizzes.

Memoet helps with your **retrieval process** by providing a quiz form to every notes to gamify your learning.

### Replaying easy games is no fun

Quizzes are entertaining, but to play an easy quiz again and again is no fun at all. You want to play hard quizzes more and easy ones less.

Memoet helps with your **repetition process** by spacing notes using SuperMemo2 algorithm to make hard notes appear more frequent and easy notes less so.

### Creating notes one by one is slow

For original content you may want to creating your own quiz one by one. But we can make them better.

Memoet helps with your **input process** by providing REST APIs for most of UI's tasks. Instead of creating a quiz through web UI, developers and hobbyists can talk directly to our server using JSON language.
