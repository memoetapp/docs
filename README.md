# Introduction

### Re-reading notes is inefficient

Rereading your notes over and over again is not efficient, and really not fun. To remember your notes, you have to **retrieve** knowledge from your brain by writing things down, or playing some quizzes.

Memoet helps with your **retrieval process** by providing a quiz form to every notes to gamify your learning.

### Re-playing easy games is no fun

Quizzes are entertaining, but to play an easy quiz again and again is no fun at all. You want to play hard quizzes more and easy ones less.

Memoet helps with your **repetition process** by spacing notes using SuperMemo2 algorithm to make hard notes appear more frequent and easy notes less so.

### Creating notes one-by-one is slow

For original content you may want to creating your own quiz one by one. For the rest, it should be way more easier.

Memoet helps with your **input process** by providing batch notes import using CSV files. Now you can create thousands of notes to learn later.

For developers and hobbyists, we do provide RESTful APIs for decks and notes so you can talk directly to our server using JSON language.
