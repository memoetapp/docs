# Batch import notes using CSV

### Step 1: Create your deck

You can only import notes to an existing deck for now, so you must create a deck first.

{% hint style="info" %}
 You should start with an empty deck to avoid mixing notes together.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Go to "Import notes" option and choose your CSV file

CSV file must conform to a predefined template to be imported successfully. Get the template file in your import page.

### Step 3: Wait a little bit for new notes to appear in your deck

If your CSV file is small, you might not have to wait at all.
